## Bellingcat - Presentation and work (via ChatGPT)

1. Bellingcat is an investigative journalism organization based in Amsterdam, founded in 2014 by Eliot Higgins. The organization specializes in using OSINT to investigate global events, such as armed conflicts, security incidents, and human rights violations. 

2. Their method is to collect and analyze open data, such as images, videos, testimonies, and documents, from publicly available sources on the Internet. Bellingcat investigators also work with other media organizations to obtain additional information and verify facts. The results of their investigations have been published in many reputable media outlets, such as The New York Times, The Guardian, Der Spiegel and BBC News. Thanks to these methods, they are able to investigate faster than traditional medias.

4. Their work started with Syrian crisis in 2011, when Bashal el-Assad used chemical weapons against Syria inhabitants. Here are some notable work : MH17 flight (which was took down by Russia in 2014), war in Eastern Ukraine, El Junquito raid, Yemeni Civil War, Skripal poisoning, Christchurch mosque shootings, poisoning of Alexei Navalny, the **Maria Adela** case (who was in fact a GRU spy), and so on. And in addition to their investigative work, Bellingcat organizes trainings and workshops to teach journalists, human rights advocates and citizens how to conduct investigations using open source.

5. They are funded through donations and subscriptions from various organizations and foundations. They have a team of survey professionals and researchers, as well as a community of volunteer contributors (which I am part of, somehow). Their work is checked several times by a team of experts, and they are able to quickly process and publish it.

6. In short, Bellingcat is an investigative journalism organization that uses innovative open source-based investigative methods to uncover information about important and sensitive world events. They have a strong reputation for quality work and a commitment to transparency and independence. They are becoming an essential part of the journalism landscape, as some OSINT communities rise to help people recover the truth.
