## Short notice

This article, entirely wrote by me, is designed to inform non-french people about how French are currently organising when protesting.
I'll avoid as much as I can to give my personal opinion and try to be clear as possible.

## So, how do they do ?

Well, it's quite a complicated question. <br>
But we need to put a little context : <br>
- First, in France, there are several Unions. But according to [this article](https://dares.travail-emploi.gouv.fr/donnees/la-syndicalisation), only 10.3% of public & private workers were members of one in 2019. The biggest Union for public/private workers is CFDT, which stands for French Confederation for Labor Democracy.
