# Quick introduction to protests in France

* * *

## <ins> 1. Preamble </ins>

This article, entirely written by me, is designed to inform non-french people about how the French are currently organizing when protesting. I’ll avoid as much as I can give my personal opinion and try to be as clear as possible. All the sources can be found at the end of the article.<br>
<br>

## <ins> 2. So, how do they do ? </ins>

Well, it’s quite a complicated question.<br><br>
The summary will be as follows:<br>
-- First, we will explain a bit about the context of protesting in France, what are the risks, and how people organize everything; <br>
-- Second, we will dig a bit further into “How to organize a perfect French protest” ; <br>
-- And finally, we are going to evoke a little about the current situation of protests and strikes in France, what are the risks for this right, and how to do NGOs fight for it. <br>
<br>

### <ins> A little context </ins>

-- In France, there are several Unions. The biggest Union for public/private workers is CFDT, which stands for French Democratic Confederation for Labor (FDCL). But according to the DARES (Animation, statistics and research direction), only 10.1% (around 3 million people out of 29,2 million) of public & private workers were members of a Union in 2019.<br><br>

-- Media often cover strikes and protests, but it quite ends up in stigmatization: during the SNCF strike in Dec. 2022, protesters were described as “sentimental hostage takers” or the general movement as a “scandal”, because it was during X-Mas holidays.<br><br>

### <ins> Illegal protest and police violence during protests </ins>

-- There is an illegal point in French law for protests and strikes, regarding international laws: as Amnesty International says, “[…] The implementation of legislative and judicial mechanisms […] leave room for arbitrariness.”. It also mentions that “[…] a demonstration does not need to be authorized to be legal, but its declaration is mandatory.[…] An undeclared demonstration becomes [...] illegal, which amounts to making the prior declaration a kind of authorization mechanism.”. <br><br>
-- It is also worth mentioning that policemen often disproportionately use force, resulting in several incidents with defense weapons.<br>
<br>

<!--## <ins>3. General functionning </ins>

So, here we are. You want to protest against something, let's say, a law is about to pass and you don't want it. But you want to do it *à la française*. How to proceed ?<br><br>
First, if you're part of an association, you should fill up a "model of prior declaration of an event on the public highway". It will ensure you have all the necessary authorizations from townhalls/prefecture to run this protest. You'll need to depose it minimum 3 clear days before the protest and maximum 15 days before it. -<br>
Second, you will need to... *wait*.-->
