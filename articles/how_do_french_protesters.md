# Quick introduction to protests in France

## Short notice

This article, entirely wrote by me, is designed to inform non-french people about how French are currently organising when protesting.
I'll avoid as much as I can to give my personal opinion and try to be clear as possible.

## So, how do they do ?

Well, it's quite a complicated question. <br>
The summary will be as follows:<br>
-- First, we will explain a bit the context of protesting in France, what are the risks and how do people organize everything ;<br>
-- Second, we will  dig a bit further into "How to organize a perfect french protest" ; <br>
-- And finally, we are going to evoke a little about the current situation of protesting and strikes in France, what are the risks for this right and how do NGO fight for it. <br>

### A little context

- First, in France, there are several Unions. The biggest Union for public/private workers is CFDT, which stands for French Democratic Confederation for Labor (FDCL). But according to [this article](https://dares.travail-emploi.gouv.fr/donnees/la-syndicalisation), only 10.3% (around 3 million people out of 29,2 million) of public & private workers were members of an Union in 2019. <br>
- Medias often cover strikes and protests, but it quite ends up in stigmatisation : during the SNCF strike in Dec. 2022, protester were described as "sentimental hostage takers" ([France Bleu](https://www.francebleu.fr/infos/societe/c-est-une-prise-d-otage-la-greve-a-la-sncf-pour-le-week-end-de-noel-contrarient-les-mayennais-3921103), [Europe 1](https://www.europe1.fr/economie/edito-la-greve-a-la-sncf-une-prise-dotage-sociale-3926635), etc.), or the general movement as a "scandal" ([La Libre](https://www.lalibre.be/economie/entreprises-startup/2022/12/21/une-prise-dotage-un-scandale-vive-polemique-en-france-suite-a-lannulation-de-centaines-de-trains-sncf-lors-des-fetes-de-noel-UAEJVR24HZCG7OFKAWREW3EPVI/), [Ouest-France](https://www.ouest-france.fr/pays-de-la-loire/nantes-44000/greve-a-la-sncf-christelle-morancais-fustige-l-esprit-egoiste-de-ces-inconscients-4782f01c-8203-11ed-95d2-87cbdb857717)), because it was during X-Mas holidays.<br>
- There is also an illegal point in French law for protests and strikes : as [Amnesty International](https://www.amnesty.org/fr/) says, "[...] in France, protest right has deteriorated. At issue: the implementation of legislative and judicial mechanisms that leave room for arbitrariness." (read it [here](https://www.amnesty.fr/dossiers/droit-de-manifester-en-france)). It also mentions that "[...] a demonstration does not need to be authorized to be legal, but its declaration is mandatory. The French law does not say it as such, but an undeclared demonstration becomes in fact illegal, which amounts to making the prior declaration a kind of authorization mechanism." ([focus here](https://www.amnesty.fr/focus/tout-savoir-sur-le-droit-de-manifester-en-france)).<br>
- It is also worth to mention that policemen often use force in disproportionate way resulting in several incidents with defense weapons. The most recent article is about [the mega-pool planned in the Deux-SÃ¨vres](https://www.lexpress.fr/sciences-sante/sante/forte-hausse-des-blessures-aux-yeux-par-lbd-depuis-les-gilets-jaunes_2105492.html) (french department).<br>
