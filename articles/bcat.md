## Bellingcat: The Digital Detectives Changing Journalism

Ever heard of Bellingcat? If not, buckle up – you're in for a ride.

Picture this: It's 2014, and a guy named Eliot Higgins decides to shake up the world of journalism from Amsterdam. His brainchild? Bellingcat – a scrappy team of digital sleuths who've made it their mission to uncover the truth about global events using nothing but publicly available information.

These folks aren't your typical journalists. They're like the CIA of the internet, minus the fancy gadgets and black suits. Their superpower? OSINT – Open Source Intelligence. They scour the web for images, videos, social media posts – you name it – to piece together what really happened in conflicts, crimes, and controversies around the globe.

Bellingcat's claim to fame? They're fast. Like, really fast. While traditional media is still trying to get boots on the ground, these digital detectives are already piecing together the puzzle. They've tackled everything from the Syrian crisis and the downing of flight MH17 to the poisoning of Alexei Navalny. Oh, and remember that story about "Maria Adela," the socialite who turned out to be a Russian spy? Yep, that was them too.

But here's the kicker – they're not keeping their methods secret. Bellingcat runs workshops to teach everyday people how to be digital detectives. It's like they're creating an army of internet Sherlock Holmes.

Now, you might be wondering, "Who's bankrolling all this?" Well, it's a mix of donations and subscriptions. They've got a core team of pros, but they also rely on a network of volunteers (yours truly included, in a small way).

Don't think for a second that this is some fly-by-night operation, though. Their work goes through rigorous fact-checking before it sees the light of day. And when it does? You'll find it in heavy-hitters like The New York Times, The Guardian, and BBC News.

In a nutshell, Bellingcat is turning the world of investigative journalism on its head. They're proving that sometimes, the truth isn't buried in deep, dark secrets – it's hiding in plain sight on the internet. And as more OSINT communities pop up, Bellingcat is leading the charge in this new frontier of journalism.

So next time you hear about a major world event, remember – there's a good chance a group of internet sleuths is already on the case, armed with nothing but their laptops and a whole lot of determination.
