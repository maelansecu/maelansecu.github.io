## Resolution

At first, I had no idea where to look for some hints. I then guessed a bit about which monument was represented on what was looking like a phone.
It's the aqueduct of Segovia. I then got a result pointing towards [TripAdvisor](https://www.tripadvisor.fr/Attraction_Review-g187494-d15841529-Reviews-Estatua_del_diablo_Segodeus-Segovia_Province_of_Segovia_Castile_and_Leon.html), telling us that it was the "Segodeus" statue.

While Googling "segodeus statue", I got an [article from "Le Monde" (in french)](https://www.lemonde.fr/international/article/2019/02/12/en-espagne-le-diable-sur-le-banc-des-accuses_5422241_3210.html), stating that there was a debate about this statue.
The name of its author is mentionned near the end : "José Antonio Adella". A few other articles helped me to check that there wasn't anything wrong with author's name.

And here is our flag : `GH22{josé_antonio_adella}` !
