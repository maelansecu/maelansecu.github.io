## Short notice

This article, entirely wrote by me, is designed to inform non-french people about how French are currently organising when protesting.
I'll avoid as much as I can to give my personal opinion and try to be clear as possible.

## So, how do they do ?

Well, it's quite a complicated question. <br>
But we need to put a little context : <br>
- First, in France, there are several Unions. The biggest Union for public/private workers is CFDT, which stands for French Democratic Confederation for Labor (FDCL). But according to [this article](https://dares.travail-emploi.gouv.fr/donnees/la-syndicalisation), only 10.3% (around 3 million people out of 29,2 million) of public & private workers were members of an Union in 2019.
- Medias often cover strikes and protests, but it quite ends up in stigmatisation : during the SNCF strike in Dec. 2022, protester were described as "sentimental hostage takers" ([France Bleu](https://www.francebleu.fr/infos/societe/c-est-une-prise-d-otage-la-greve-a-la-sncf-pour-le-week-end-de-noel-contrarient-les-mayennais-3921103), [Europe 1](https://www.europe1.fr/economie/edito-la-greve-a-la-sncf-une-prise-dotage-sociale-3926635), etc.), or te general movement as a "scandal" ([La Libre](https://www.lalibre.be/economie/entreprises-startup/2022/12/21/une-prise-dotage-un-scandale-vive-polemique-en-france-suite-a-lannulation-de-centaines-de-trains-sncf-lors-des-fetes-de-noel-UAEJVR24HZCG7OFKAWREW3EPVI/), [Ouest-France](https://www.ouest-france.fr/pays-de-la-loire/nantes-44000/greve-a-la-sncf-christelle-morancais-fustige-l-esprit-egoiste-de-ces-inconscients-4782f01c-8203-11ed-95d2-87cbdb857717), because it was during X-Mas holidays.
