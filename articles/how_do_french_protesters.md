# Quick introduction to protests in France

## Short notice

This article, entirely wrote by me, is designed to inform non-french people about how French are currently organising when protesting.
I'll avoid as much as I can to give my personal opinion and try to be as clear as possible.
All the sources can be found in the end of the article.

## So, how do they do ?

Well, it's quite a complicated question. <br>
The summary will be as follows:<br>
-- First, we will explain a bit the context of protesting in France, what are the risks and how do people organize everything ;<br>
-- Second, we will  dig a bit further into "How to organize a perfect french protest" ; <br>
-- And finally, we are going to evoke a little about the current situation of protesting and strikes in France, what are the risks for this right and how do NGO fight for it. <br>

### A little context

- First, in France, there are several Unions. The biggest Union for public/private workers is CFDT, which stands for French Democratic Confederation for Labor (FDCL). But according to the DARES (Animation, statistics and research direction), only 10.1% (around 3 million people out of 29,2 million) of public & private workers were members of an Union in 2019. <br>
- Medias often cover strikes and protests, but it quite ends up in stigmatisation : during the SNCF strike in Dec. 2022, protester were described as "sentimental hostage takers" or the general movement as a "scandal", because it was during X-Mas holidays.<br>

<br>
<br>

### Illegal protest and police violence during protests

-- There is an illegal point in French law for protests and strikes, in regard of international laws : as Amnesty Internationalsays, "[...] The implementation of legislative and judicial mechanisms [...] leave room for arbitrariness." . It also mentions that "[...] a demonstration does not need to be authorized to be legal, but its declaration is mandatory.[...] An undeclared demonstration becomes in fact illegal, which amounts to making the prior declaration a kind of authorization mechanism." .<br>
-- It is also worth to mention that policemen often use force in disproportionate way resulting in several incidents with defense weapons.<br>
